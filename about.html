						I'm a UX/UI Designer based in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I'm currently working for the United Nations
						Development Programme (UNDP). I believe that transparency, collaboration and diversity are the
						keys to build an awesome product.

						I have a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, but I also took many classes of Graphic Design and
						Fine Arts in the University, which gave me strong design foundations.
					</p>

						I started my professional career as Motion Designer followed by Frontend Developer and now I'm a
						happy Experience Designer, working with digital products.
