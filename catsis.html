						An app to find someone to help with taking care of your cat. It could be
						someone to take them to the vet while you working, visiting them while you are
						traveling, administrating medication, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the user journey, I tried to summarize some actions, so that when you go further
						on the flow, some content is already filled. The idea is to illustrate which pages would
						be there.
