						This project is an initiative of the National Council of Justice (CNJ) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The "Fazendo Justi√ßa" program aims to overcome the historical challenges that characterize the deprivation of liberty in Brazil.
					</p>

					<p>
						As the only Designer of the project, I helped the manager with product metrics and strategy. I was responsible for all visual production, including branding, prototyping and presentations.
					</p>

					<p>
						I also started the platform's Design System, in which I've created the component library in Figma, defined the theme and I'm currently customizing the frontend project according to the our patterns and definitions. 
					</p>

					<p>Down below are some screenshots from the begining of the Design System.
						The logo and some components were changed/erased because of the non-disclosure agreement.
