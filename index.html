										In the user journey, I tried to summarize some actions, so that when you go further
										on the flow, some content is already filled. The idea is to illustrate which pages would

											My project is an initiative of the National Council of Justice (CNJ) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The "Fazendo Justi√ßa" program aims to overcome the historical challenges that characterize the deprivation of liberty in Brazil.
										</p>
					
										<p>
											As the only Designer of the project, I helped the manager with product metrics and strategy. I was responsible for all visual production, including branding, prototyping and presentations.
										</p>
					
										<p>
											I also started the platform's Design System, in which I've created the component library in Figma, defined the theme and I'm currently customizing the frontend project according to the our patterns and definitions. 
										</p>

										<p>Down below are some screenshots from the begining of the Design System.
											The logo and some components were changed/erased because of the non-disclosure agreement.

										<p>
											The client was an United States franchisor and operator of fitness centers with more than 2000 franchisees and over 14.4 million users.
										</p>
										<p>
											I worked in a team with two other designers, in which we were responsible for ideation, prototyping, and strategy of some of our client's main digital products. Those include the join flow, which was the main channel for customers acquisition. We worked intentionally on collecting metrics and purposing enhancements, an initiative that led to a 1,15% increase in the total conversion.
										</p>
					
										<p>
											I implemented a dashboard to see how the product was impacted by technical metrics as loading, interactivity, and visual stability. This dashboard was also used to monitoring A/B experiments that I helped to define and implement.
										</p>
					
										<p>
											Along with a fellow developer, we led the definitions, architecture, and implementation of the company's design system. I also paired with other developers on the implementation of React components for the team's custom library.
										</p>
					
										<p>
											I have facilitated many design sessions with the client, my team and users. I also advocate for usability and accessibility good practices, on a daily basis.

										<p>
											Over the course of 2 years, I was part of a team that handled the flights' search, and the passenger information pages. 
										</p>
										<p>
											At the time, I worked as a developer, focused on software quality and working with test-driven development, clean code, continuous integration and delivery, pair programming, pull-requests, and code reviews as everyday practices.
										</p>
										<p>
											I paired with the client's Experience Designer many times, including in our Design Sprint, helping them to conduct usability tests.
										</p>
					
										<p>
											I led an accessibility initiative to turn those pages in our domain, WCAG (AA) complaint. I mapped all the needs, and created an action plan, that was executed collaboratively between UX Designers and Developers.
										</p>

										<p>
											I facilitate several sessions and made presentations about consultancy, feedback, and agile methodologies, for the client and my collegues.
